Rules of the game:

The maximum score of the game is 21 points, if the player or dealer exceeds this score, they automatically lose.

After pressing the "Draw cards" button, a random card is drawn and its value is added to the player's score.
If the player's total is for example 20 and the dealer's is 15, you can press the "I stay" button because there is a small chance that the dealer 
will draw a card that will give him the score of 21 needed to win.
